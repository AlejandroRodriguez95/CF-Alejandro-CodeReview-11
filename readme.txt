CRUD system made with PHP using SQL

Filters animals by age (senior means more than 8 years old)


4. Login data:
ADMIN (normal one):
email: normaladmin@admin.com
password: admin123

SUPERADMIN:
email: admin@admin.com
password: superadmin123

Normal user (you can create more by registrating):
email: alejandro@gmail.com
password: user123

There's no validation in the CRUD, as it was not a requirement, and it was not a real project. If it was needed, it would be easy to implement.
